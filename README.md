New Uptade :
- Controlling the ball was challenging in the previous version. With the new update, ball control has been significantly enhanced, making it much easier to maneuver.
- The sphere has been replaced with a soccer ball. Additionally, in the previous version, we used a cylinder to progress to the next level; now, the cylinder has been replaced with a soccer goal.
- The design of the levels has been refreshed. In the previous version, all levels were the same color and didn't look visually appealing.
- Now, we can move within the game using the mouse. This feature was not available in the previous version.
- A main menu has been added to the game. Our previous version did not include a main menu.
